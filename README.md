# Responsive Photo Gallery

## Introduction

"Responsive Photo Gallery" is a project where I share my love for traveling and photography. It contains images from various travel destinations that I have captured during my travels. The project is built using [Lightbox2](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/). 

## Features

```bash
- Overlay gallery
- Lightbox slider
- Responsive mode 
- Slide left or right manually or pc arrow key press
```

## Gallery

You can explore my travel photography by clicking on an image, each image has a hover effect with a black overlay. After selecting an image a modal window pops up displaying an expanded image and it's details.
